- testing fastify instead of express (supports async/await nicely, no need for try-catch blocks)
- using ES6 modules (easier for making incremental changes to code)
- would be nice if OSS SDK provided convenience methods (e.g., collating paginated results)
- maybe move the "is model ready?" checks to the client?
